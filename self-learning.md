# Self-learning

Since September 2015 I have taken a plethora of online courses aimed at self-learning. There is greatvariability in the ammount of assessment, interactivity and duration of these courses, with some lasting only an hour and consisting of simple video (several Udemy and Stackskills courses), to courses designed for several hours of study a week and assessment with identity validation (Coursera).
